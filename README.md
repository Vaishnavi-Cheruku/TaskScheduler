Certainly! Here's a README.md file content for your task scheduler project, providing a brief description, features, how to use instructions, and acknowledgments:

Task Scheduler
Overview
The Task Scheduler is a console-based application written in C that allows users to manage and schedule tasks efficiently. It utilizes topological sorting to optimize task scheduling based on dependencies and deadlines.

Features
Optimal Task Scheduling: Utilizes Depth-First Search (DFS) for topological sorting to determine the optimal schedule based on task dependencies and deadlines.
Task Submission: Users can submit tasks, updating their submission status and notifying when a task has been submitted.
Task Details Display: View detailed information about each task, including duration, start time, deadline, and submission status.
Interactive Menu: Main menu provides options to view the optimal task schedule, submit tasks, display task details, and exit the application.
How to Use
Compilation:

Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC).
Compile the program using the following command:
bash
Copy code
gcc -o taskproject taskproject.c
Execution:

Run the compiled executable:
bash
Copy code
./taskproject
Input Instructions:

Follow on-screen prompts to input task details, including task names, durations, dependencies, and deadlines.
Submit tasks, view schedules, and display task details through the interactive menu.
Example Usage
Upon running the program, users can:

Input task details, ensuring valid inputs for durations, dependencies, and deadlines.
Submit tasks as they are completed.
View an optimized task schedule showing start times, deadlines, and submission statuses.
Acknowledgments
This project utilizes concepts of data structures and algorithms, specifically DFS for topological sorting, to achieve efficient task scheduling. Special thanks to the C programming community for valuable insights and resources.
